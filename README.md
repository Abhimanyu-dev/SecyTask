# Attendance App

To run the app you must first start the backend server and then the frontend.

### First clone the repository and change the directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhimanyu-dev/SecyTask.git
cd SecyTask
```


### To start the backend server:
While in the SecyTask directory
```bash
cd backend
node ./app.js 
```
This starts the express server on localhost:3000

### To start the frontend:
While in the SecyTask directory
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

This should get both your frontend and backend started with no issues.
